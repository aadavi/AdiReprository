			System.out.print(arr[i]+"\t");
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
 
			if (arr[i] > largest) {
				secondLargest = largest;

        m = s.nextInt();
        while(m > 0)
        {
            n = m % 10;
            sum = sum + n;

        // into bytes[]. 
        byte [] strAsByteArray = input.getBytes(); 
  
        byte [] result =  
                   new byte [strAsByteArray.length]; 
  
        // Store result in reverse order into the 
        // result byte[] 
        for (int i = 0; i<strAsByteArray.length; i++)
